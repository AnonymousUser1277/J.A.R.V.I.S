> **A fully autonomous, context-aware, voice-activated AI assistant for Windows.**

JARVIS is not just a chatbot; it is a complete system controller. It integrates State-of-the-Art LLMs (Groq, Cohere, Gemini) with local automation to manage your PC, analyze your screen, secure your system with Face ID, and even sync with a mobile companion app.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Advanced AI Core
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Seamlessly switches between **Groq** (Llama 3), **Cohere**, **Gemini**, **HuggingFace**, **Mistral**, and **OpenRouter**.
*   **Smart Context Awareness:** Understands what is on your screen, your clipboard content, active window, and system status (CPU/RAM/Battery).
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** Learns your daily patterns and suggests actions (e.g., opening apps, taking breaks) before you ask.
*   **Redis Caching:** Instant responses for repeated commands using a local hash-based cache.

### 🗣️ Voice & Interaction
*   **Real-time STT & TTS:** Features a custom Selenium-based Speech-to-Text engine for unlimited dictation and high-quality Native SAPI or Web-based Text-to-Speech.
*   **Wake Word Detection:** Always listening for "Jarvis" to wake up and execute commands.
*   **Floating Orb UI:** A futuristic, animated desktop widget that indicates listening/processing states.

### 👁️ Vision & Security
*   **Multimodal Vision:** Uses **Google Gemini Vision** to "see" your screen or webcam feed. Ask questions like *"What is this code error?"* or *"Describe what I am holding."*
*   **Biometric Security:** Built-in **Face Recognition** authentication system. JARVIS only unlocks for you.

### ⚡ Automation & Tools
*   **OCR Screen Control:** Can click buttons or read text anywhere on screen using Tesseract OCR.
*   **Python Executor:** Generates and runs Python code locally to perform complex tasks (file management, math, system control) with safety checks.
*   **Document Generation:** Creates professional Word (.docx), Markdown, or Text reports from voice prompts.
*   **Image Generation:** Creates AI art using Stable Diffusion (via HuggingFace) and saves it locally.

### 🌐 Connectivity
*   **Mobile Companion:** Control JARVIS remotely from your phone via a local Flask/SocketIO server.
*   **Smart Home & Work:** Integrates with **Gmail** (read/send) and **Local Calendars** (.ics) for schedule management.
*   **Browser Bridge:** Chrome extension integration to read active URLs.
